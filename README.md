# Furniture Price Calculator - Java OOP

This project is a Java-based console application developed for Vivek Furniture Store. It calculates the final payable amount for steel and wooden beros based on their type, size, and associated discounts. The application demonstrates core object-oriented programming concepts such as **inheritance**, **abstraction**, **encapsulation**, and **polymorphism**.
